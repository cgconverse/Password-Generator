# Password-Generator

This password generator creates a unique password based on criteria the user selects.

The user is prompted to answer a series of questions to determine whether or not they want to include upper/lower case letters, numbers and special characters. The user is also asked to determine how long they want their password to be (between 8 and 128 characters).

A random password is generated that includes the user's selected criteria.

# Challenges 

I really struggled on this assignment. I'm still trying to grasp the basic concepts of JavaScript, especially for loops, functions and events.

# Goals

In the future, I plan to make this application fully function by successfully generating a random password based on the user's selected criteria.
