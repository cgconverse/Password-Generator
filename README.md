# Password-Generator

## Description

This password generator creates a unique password based on criteria the user selects.

The user is prompted to answer a series of questions to determine whether or not they want to include upper/lower case letters, numbers and special characters. The user is also asked to determine how long they want their password to be (between 8 and 128 characters).

After selecting which criteria they want to include, the user's password is generated and displayed in the text area.
